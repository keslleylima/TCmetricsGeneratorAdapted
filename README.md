# TCmetricsGeneratorAdapted
An adapted version of the [TCmetricsGerenator](https://github.com/keslleylima/TCmetricsGenerator) at the test suite level.

This simple application that receives as input the test requirements and a set of test paths, to create the following test case metrics:
* AvgPathLength
* Hasloop
* AvgCountLoop
* CountReqPPCCovered
* CountReqECCovered
* PrimePathCoverage
* EdgeCoverage


We developed this tool to generate the defined metrics to illustrate possible uses of the dataset detailed in the paper "A dataset based on two graph coverage criteria: prime-path and edge coverage"
